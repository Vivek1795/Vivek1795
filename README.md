## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🛬 UAV Precision Landing using Kalman Filter (Simulink)
Developed a real-time control and tracking system in MATLAB/Simulink for UAVs to land on moving targets using GPS, IMU, and camera fusion.

### 🌊 Co-operative Multi-AUV Navigation
Implemented consensus-based path planning and coordination for underwater vehicles using Simulink state machines.

### 🧠 Swarm-Level Task Learning (HRL)
Built a decentralized multi-agent system using reward machines and TensorFlow to achieve task execution with 3.2x sample efficiency.

### ✋ Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm
Controlled a 6-DOF robotic arm using real-time hand detection and inverse kinematics. Integrated OpenCV and MyCobot SDK.

### 🦇 Bat-Inspired Foldable Wing Robot
Designed a servo-driven biomimetic flapping wing using a 4-bar mechanism. Simulated aerodynamic performance in MuJoCo and improved energy efficiency by 25%.
